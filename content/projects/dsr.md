title = "The Donor Sibling Registry community engagement platform"
description = "The DSR is _the_ hub for donor-conceived people, their families, and interested donors. Members are able to connect with each other and share their experiences. The site has a thriving userbase, but was built in PHP in the early 2000's, patched multiple times over the years, and in desperate need of a rebuild."

* Extensively analyzed the old site's code, to be able to replicate functionality on the new site.
* Sanitized, normalized, and migrated legacy data that hadn't been pruned in decades.
* Leveraged refreshed data to rewrite and optimize slow queries, as well as run reporting and metrics queries for the first time.
* Moved devops concerns into Google Cloud Platform, with version control, configuration management, full-coverage testing, and automated deploys.
* Championed UX and performed functional UI design with an inexperienced client.
* Walked with client toward a new, modernized vision of the website while still delivering their on-spec requirements.
* Worked within the tightly constrained budget of a non-profit.
