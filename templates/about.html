        Well, I'm Jason of course! I’ve always loved building things,
        from CNC-routered wheels of fortune, to sound-reactive LED totem poles.
        I have a very healthy, definitely-not-concerning obsession with
        organizing things into bins. I’m self-taught (and self-sabotaging)
        and like learnin’ stuff.

        And I spend a lot of time going down mountains on various wheels
        and planks.

        I guess you might be here hoping I can do some programming, and yes
        I do a lot of that too. Does it come with LEDs or bins?
